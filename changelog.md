# Version history of Node.js server for offline export of ECharts graphs

_(Note: This changelog focuses on the major changes between the different
versions. Therefore, it may not contain all changes. Especially smaller fixes or
improvements may be omitted.)_

As a general rule the version tries to follow the
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme.
Since [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/) is the main dependency of this
application, major version changes in ECharts will also trigger a major version
change in this application.

## Version 1.0.0

This is the initial release.
